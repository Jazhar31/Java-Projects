Classes and Objects (Dungeon Game)


Juwairiyyah Azhar


1. To compile all three files together: type javac *.java
2. To run: java HW6


Bonus/Extra Features:


I randomly generated treasures, so that when the user goes into a room, they can pick up a treasure! As you enter the room, you will find the treasure!


Bugs/Compile Time Errors:


* For my currentRoom variable name, I was getting errors as such: non-static variable currentRoom cannot be referenced from a static context. Sometimes, I had to change the variable to static to solve this or make the variable local.


* I also got “identifer expected” errors because I forgot to write the Room type and only wrote Room in the parameters, so I kind of got familiar with those errors.


* The usual errors where I forget semicolons or return something but unintentionally put “void” as the return type.


I couldn’t put the best effort into this assignment because I had the exam to worry about, but I think I got a hold of it once I understood what was going on and what the getters, setters, and constructors were used for.
